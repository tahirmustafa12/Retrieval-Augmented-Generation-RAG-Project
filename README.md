# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Project
📘 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project
🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using modern NLP tools.
RAG combines vector search with a large language model (LLM) to provide more accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant data chunks before generating a response.

The project includes:

Loading a custom dataset (text/PDF/scraped content)

Generating embeddings and storing them in a vector database

Retrieving relevant chunks using semantic search

Passing retrieved chunks into an LLM for contextual question answering

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

LLM: OpenAI API / Hugging Face models

Vector Database: FAISS

Embeddings: Hugging Face Sentence Transformers

Frameworks & Libraries:

langchain

faiss

transformers

openai (for LLM calls)

pypdf (for PDF loading)

matplotlib & IPython.display (for visualization & screenshots)

📝 Steps Implemented

Dataset Loading – Load small text/PDF dataset.

Embedding Generation – Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using Hugging Face.

Database Creation – Store embeddings in FAISS.

Retrieval – Fetch top-k most relevant chunks based on user query.

LLM Integration – Send retrieved context to OpenAI/HuggingFace LLM.

Answer Generation – Display final AI-generated answer.
